Developed a machine learningâ€“based NLP system for real-time toxicity detection, leveraging the Jigsaw Unintended Bias dataset (500K+ comments); engineered models using BoW, TF-IDF, LSTM, and SGD achieving 97.72% accuracy and 0.0228 MSE, while actively mitigating demographic bias across identity subgroups.
